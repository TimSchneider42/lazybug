\section{Policy and Value Function}
\label{sec:pv}
Similar to AlphaZero\cite{alphazero}, we use a single convolutional neural network (CNN) to represent both the policy $p_{\sigma} (a|s)$ and the value function $v_\sigma (s)$ (see \autoref{subsec:net}).
As further described in \autoref{subsec:sl}, the network is trained in supervised learning fashion on a large data set of human games.
